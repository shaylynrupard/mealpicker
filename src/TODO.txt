TODO FUNCTIONALITY:
    - GENERAL:
        - gui
    - ADD/REMOVE/VIEW:
        - quantity of ingredients (i.e. this recipe needs 3 eggs vs. one loaf of bread works for
          multiple recipes)
        - update ID in database to fill in gaps for removed recipies
        - multiple meal_type meals (i.e. dinner and lunch, etc.)
            - includes adding potential either option to meal picking
        - meal generates leftovers?
            - includes adding leftover option to meal picking
        - add caloric information
            - includes adding caloric calculating to meal picking
    - PICK:
        - eat out options
        - avoid meals with duplicate protein
            - (search for protein type in ingredients? before entering into the database so can be sorted by that?)
        - base repeat of meal on recipe itself rather than just type
        - write chosen meals to a file (to remember which recipes were chosen for that day?)
    - SHOPPING LIST:
        - specify output location for shopping list
        - better way to get ingredients than nested for loops?
        - sort shopping list
